  brandstory_part2: "Then we need a way to make it real. A way to empower everyone who grows, sells and buys food. A way to tell all the stories, to handle all the logistics. A way to turn transaction into transformation every day."
  brandstory_part3: "So we build an online marketplace that levels the playing field. It’s transparent, so it creates real relationships. It’s open source, so it’s owned by everyone. It scales to regions and nations, so people start versions across the world."
  brandstory_part4: "It works everywhere. It changes everything."

  modal_hubs: "Food Hubs"
  modal_hubs_abstract: Our food hubs are the point of contact between you and the people who make your food! 
  modal_hubs_content1: You can search for a convenient hub by location or name. Some hubs have multiple points where you can pick-up your purchases, and some will also provide delivery options. Each food hub is a sales point with independent business operations and logistics - so variations between hubs are to be expected. 
  modal_hubs_content2: You can only shop at one food hub at a time.

  modal_groups: "Groups / Regions"
  modal_groups_content1: These are the organisations and relationships between hubs which make up the Open Food Network. 
  modal_groups_content2: Some groups are clustered by location or council, others by non-geographic similarities. 

  modal_how: "How it works"
  modal_how_shop: Shop the Open Food Network
  modal_how_shop_explained: Search for a food hub near you to start shopping! You can expand each food hub to see what kinds of goodies are available, and click through to start shopping. (You can only shop one food hub at a time.)
  modal_how_pickup: Pick-ups, delivery & shipping costs
  modal_how_pickup_explained: Some food hubs deliver to your door, while others require you to pick-up your purchases. You can see which options are available on the homepage, and select which you'd like at the shopping and check-out pages. Delivery will cost more, and pricing differs from hub-to-hub. Each food hub is a sales point with independent business operations and logisitics - so variations between hubs are to be expected.
